# CricketScoreboard
This Java Program calculates cricket scoreboard based on each ball info and player Info

I have created a file 'Cricket_Input.txt' which have all the input
On running the program, you'll be asked whether to take input from user or from File (mentioned above):

  1. from User
  2. from File

After that it will take inputs and do the calculations and give the scoreboard result in console or terminal
